/**
 * This Iterator will take a list of flavor name and trailing build type and iterate over all
 * possible (partial) variants from those.
 *
 * The partial variants will be iterated over in increasing order of priority.
 * Product flavors that belong to the first flavor dimension have a higher priority than
 * those belonging to the second flavor dimension.
 *
 * E.g.: for the variant with flavor names ["pro", "green", "release"], the iterator will
 * return the following values (in order):
 * "release", "green", "greenRelease", "pro", "proRelease", "proGreen", "proGreenRelease"
